-- TASK-207 follow-up (Codex review on PR #6): the previous migration
-- (20260727120000) only logged iteration_id changes made by
-- finalize_iteration's rollover, via an explicit self-recorded INSERT. But
-- iteration_id changes through other paths too -- move_story_board is the
-- ordinary Backlog<->Current drag, and it does a plain UPDATE on the same
-- column. Those writes logged nothing, so an ordinary reschedule (not just
-- an automated rollover) silently rewrote both current and historical
-- burndowns instead of producing a jump on the actual change date.
--
-- Fixed at the root instead of patched per call site: log_story_activity
-- already watches stories.state_id on every UPDATE; it now also watches
-- iteration_id, independently (not mutually exclusive with a state_id
-- change in the same statement -- move_story_board can change both at
-- once when scheduling a story into a state's category for the first
-- time). This covers every write path uniformly, matching the "one
-- trigger, no per-caller duplication" rule the rest of activity_logs
-- already follows, and makes finalize_iteration's own explicit rollover
-- INSERT redundant -- its plain iteration_id UPDATE is now caught by this
-- same trigger, so that INSERT is removed.
